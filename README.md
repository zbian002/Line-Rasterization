# Description

This lab will introduce you the basic problem of rasterization. For this lab you will implement the Midpoint (MPA) line rasterization algorithm in OpenGL. Your implementation should be able to draw multiple lines of any slope without breaks. 

## Prerequisites

Download OpenGL library

## Installing

Clone this repository to a directory of your choice.

## Running the tests

* Compile: make
* Run: ./rasterize_line
* Controls:
       c: Clear old lines.
       a: Generate 1K random lines.
       A: Generate 1M random lines.
       m: Toggle between the MPA and the DDA algorithms.
       ]: Increase point size.
       [: Decrease point size.
